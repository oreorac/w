Which of the following statements are true about exceptions ?

Multiple Choice - This may have multiple correct answers. Select required answer(s) from the options list.
One should analyse what could go wrong during program execution and write exception handlers for handling these scenarios

Once the entire program is written, we should revisit the program to include code for exception handlers
